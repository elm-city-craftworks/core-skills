# Code of Conduct

All students, mentors, and instructors in Practicing Ruby's events
are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will 
enforce this code throughout all courses, events, and activities we host. 
We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe 
learning environment for everyone.

*tl;dr: Be excellent with each other.*

## Need Help?

Contact any of Practicing Ruby's instructors or organizers at any time.

## The Quick Version

Our learning environment is dedicated to providing a harassment-free 
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, 
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).
We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. 
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in any activities or
communications related to our courses and events. Participants violating 
these rules may be expelled from our learning environment at the 
discretion of the organisers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, 
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, 
following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions
or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers 
may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender 
or expulsion from the Practicing Ruby learning environment with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
or have any other concerns, please contact a mentor or instructor immediately.
Our contact information was provided at the start of your course.

Practicing Ruby's organizers will be happy to help participants contact 
law enforcement, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to 
feel safe for the duration of our events. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules throughout our
online learning environment, and also in any course-related
social events or study sessions. The basic idea is that if you're
doing anything at all related to our of our events or courses,
you're expected to abide by this Code of Conduct.
